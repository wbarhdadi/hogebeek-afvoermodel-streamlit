# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. If the concept is not in the glossary yet, note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
